### MCP Protocol Handler Test

**1. Direct protocol link (GitHub STRIPS this):**

[Install in VS (direct)](vsweb+mcp:/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22foundry-mcp-remote%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22http%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fmcp.ai.azure.com%22%7D)

**2. Via GitHub Pages redirect (should WORK):**

[Install foundry-mcp-remote in Visual Studio](https://prasethu.github.io/Spoon-Knife/redirect.html?url=vsweb%2Bmcp%3A%2Finstall%3F%7B%22name%22%3A%22foundry-mcp-remote%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22http%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fmcp.ai.azure.com%22%7D)

**3. VS Code equivalent (for comparison):**

[Install in VS Code (via vscode.dev redirect)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode%3Amcp%2Finstall%3F%257B%2522name%2522%253A%2522foundry-mcp-remote%2522%252C%2522type%2522%253A%2522http%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522https%253A%252F%252Fmcp.ai.azure.com%2522%257D)
